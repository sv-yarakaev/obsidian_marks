called by the sb cache shrinking function for the filesystem to scan the number of objects indicated to try to free them. 	Optional, but any filesystem implementing this method needs to also implement ->nr_cached_objects for it to be called 	correctly.
We can't do anything with any errors that the filesystem might 	encountered, hence the void return type.  This will never be 	called if the VM is trying to reclaim under GFP_NOFS conditions, 	hence this method does not need to handle that situation itself.
Implementations must include conditional reschedule calls inside 	any scanning loop that is done.  This allows the VFS to determine appropriate scan batch sizes without having to worry 	about whether implementations will cause holdoff problems due to 	large scan batch sizes.
