called when the VFS needs to look up an inode in a parent 	directory.  The name to look for is found in the dentry.  This method must call d_add() to insert the found inode into the 	dentry.  The "i_count" field in the inode structure should be incremented.  If the named inode does not exist a NULL inode should be inserted into the dentry (this is called a negative 	dentry).  Returning an error code from this routine must only be done on a real error, otherwise creating inodes with system calls like create(2), mknod(2), mkdir(2) and so on will fail.  If you wish to overload the dentry methods then you should initialise the "d_dop" field in the dentry; this is a pointer to a struct "dentry_operations".  This method is called with the directory inode semaphore held
