called by the VFS to follow a symbolic link to the inode it points to.  Only required if you want to support symbolic links. This method returns the symlink body to traverse (and possibly resets the current position with nd_jump_link()).  If the body won't go away until the inode is gone, nothing else is needed; if it needs to be otherwise pinned, arrange for its release by having get_link(..., ..., done) do set_delayed_call(done, destructor, argument).  In that case destructor(argument) will 	be called once VFS is done with the body you've returned.  May 	be called in RCU mode; that is indicated by NULL dentry 	argument.  If request can't be handled without leaving RCU mode, 	have it return ERR_PTR(-ECHILD).

If the filesystem stores the symlink target in ->i_link, the 	VFS may use it directly without calling ->get_link(); however, 	->get_link() must still be provided.  ->i_link must not be 	freed until after an RCU grace period.  Writing to ->i_link post-iget() time requires a 'release' memory barrier.
