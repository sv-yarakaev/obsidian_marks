An individual dentry usually has a pointer to an inode. Inodes are filesystem objects such as regular files, directories, FIFOs and other beasts. They live either on the disc (for block device filesystems) or in the memory (for pseudo filesystems). Inodes that live on the disc are copied into the memory when required and changes to the inode are written back to disc. A single inode can be pointed to by multiple dentries (hard links, for example, do this).

To look up an inode requires that the VFS calls the lookup() method of the parent directory inode. This method is installed by the specific filesystem implementation that the inode lives in. Once the VFS has the required dentry (and hence the inode), we can do all those boring things like open(2) the file, or stat(2) it to peek at the inode data. The stat(2) operation is fairly simple: once the VFS has the dentry, it peeks at the inode data and passes some of it back to userspace.
